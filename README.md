# Online-Shopping-Portal

This project was done on August 2015

Online Shopping Portal is developed using HTML5, Java script, CSS, JSP, Servlets. The central concept of the application is to allow the customer to shop virtually using the Internet and allow customers to buy the items and articles of their desire  from the store. The information pertaining to the products are stored on a database at the server side (store) using MySQL. The Server processes the customerâ€™s order and the items are shipped to the address submitted by them.
I have uploaded few of the code snippets.
